# DAA-Final-Project
This project implements a Python program that sorts delivery points efficiently using Merge Sort and searches for a specific delivery point using Binary Search. It also evaluates the performance of the sorting algorithm for different input sizes. This solution helps optimize delivery routes by organizing and accessing delivery points quickly.
